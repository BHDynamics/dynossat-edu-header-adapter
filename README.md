# DynOSSAT-EDU-Header_Adapter
DynOSSAT-EDU is the first open source PocketQube educational kit compatible with CircuitPython and Arduino.

This plaform is equipped with all the necessary modules for the operation of a nanosatellite (PocketQube)
in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) that would serve as a device for teaching, training, and driving curiosity about the philosophy and technology related to NewSpace.

This repository contains the hardware files for the Header Adapter. It is a simple board to break out the 1.27mm 2x20 pin PQBH40 bus to two 2x10 pin 2.54 mm
headers so it's easier to use with standard Dupont cables. It also includes a LED connected to D3.

Hardware in this repository is licenced under **CERN OHL v1.2**.
